            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                His research has been published in books, journals and conference proceedings via key-note speeches in
                international universities (Oxford-Brookes Rome Visiting School, Nanjing University, Beijing Institute of
                Fashion and Technology, Royal University of Bhutan, UDLAP Puebla). He has been awarded a number of national
                and international grants for his research (Italy, Scotland, China). Teaching-wise, he is the supervisor of
                several PhD candidates in XJTLU and UoL, Module Leader for the M/Arch final year project and delivers lectures
                for multiple modules within the BEng program.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a professional, he collaborates with various architecture firms on large-scale international projects and
                small design proposals in different countries (Italy, China, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Greece, Serbia).
            </p>
            <p>
                He served the Department of Architecture by holding the role as Head of Department. During the last years,
                he has been instrumental in creating streamlined processes to smoothen the regular operations related to
                departmental academic life. He took the lead in aspects such as students’ exchange schemes development,
                students’ admission pathways creation, curricula modifications and improvements, ensuring compliance with
                academic and professional body’s quality standards, marketing and outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
                He acquired experience related to professional accreditation schemes (RIBA), being part of the successful
                revalidation obtained by the UG and PG programs in 2019 and 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is a member of Design School committees and liaises with University level units. His interest in
                computational tools and strategies led him to investigate the impact of cutting-edge techniques in the field
                of blockchain technologies applied to the AEC industry, robotic fabrication and gamification of architectural
                education.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before joining XJTLU, he served at The University of Edinburgh as Teaching Fellow in Digital Architecture and Design.
